This is the task 3 of WEB AND APP DEVELOPMENT in the GRIP conducted by The Sparks Foundation.
Task: Payment gateway Integrated website.

I chose this idea because because there are many people who are in need of support, whether it's financial help, resources, or just a sense of hope. My goal is to connect generous individuals with those who need assistance, making it easier for people to contribute to meaningful causes and improve the lives of others. This website is my way of making a positive impact and encouraging others to join in building a more caring and supportive world.
